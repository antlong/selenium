Selenium Resurrection: Improved Selenium 1 bindings.
====================================================
Whats different?
----------------

2/2011: Add headers, and view your current headers via add_headers / view_headers.
		Implicit waits for all functions that take a locator. Selenium will now wait for the element to be present for 60 seconds before performing the action.

1/2011 - Added:
wait_for_element()
wait_for_element_to_disappear()
wait_until()
wait_for_attribute()
wait_for_attribute_to_disappear()
